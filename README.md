# R Ladies Aurora and Project Bridge Colorado: Presenting your work to non-scientists
## Workshop November 12, 2024
This repo contains the presentation given by *Rachael Kostelecky* and *Natasia Paukovich*. This collaborative workshop, hosted by R Ladies Aurora and Project Bridge Colorado, will offer valuable tips and tricks for communicating science to non-scientific audiences. Many scientists struggle to explain their work without relying on technical jargon, as it often feels like a second language. In this workshop, we will explore effective strategies to present complex research in a way that resonates with the general public.
